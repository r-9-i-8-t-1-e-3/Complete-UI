# Mamastops Cargo Truck Marketplace - Completed UI ✅

This project has been cleaned up and completed with missing UI essentials.

## What's Added / Fixed
- **Public folder** with:
  - `index.html` (entry point with Tailwind + React mount point)
  - `favicon.ico` (placeholder)
  - `logo.svg` (placeholder)
- **TailwindCSS config** (`tailwind.config.js`) and **PostCSS config** (`postcss.config.js`).
- **package.json scripts** ensured: `dev`, `build`, `preview`.
- Expanded README with instructions.

## How to Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Vite (bundler)
- TailwindCSS (styling)

## Notes
- Assets like logo and favicon are placeholders — replace with your branding.
- All your components (`src/components/...`) remain untouched and ready to use.
